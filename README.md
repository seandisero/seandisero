## Hello 👋

I worked previously in the video games industry for just under 7 years, during that time I gained decent experience with Python, deveoping tools for DCC programs like Autodesk Maya, and doing misc tasks in C++ in Unreal Engine. I also spent a lot of time in C# when working on personal projects in Unity. For a part of those years I was a Lighting Artist focusing on realtime lighting stratagies for third person games. Programming eventually won over my interests, and now I spend my time trying to develop that skill.

- I am currently on a mission to change careers and move into programming full time, and out of the games industry.
- I am currently learning Go as a primary language for developing my skills as a programmer.
- I have a strong pull toward Zig as my next language of choice.
- I have a passion for learning how things work.

Books I'm reading:
- Writing An Interpreter In Go
- Game of Thrones
- Harry Potter (again)
- 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Favorite Video Games:
- Elden Ring
- Skyrim
- Planetside 2

🥏 when going outside, Disc Golf is my game:
